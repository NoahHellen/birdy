Ferros is a unrelenting planet; the formidable magnetic field has made inhabiting this planet almost impossible.

Humanity is faced with many challenges to sustain life on Ferros:

* Food security
* Communication
* Transport

The advent of **Birdy** will make communication problems a thing of the past!

## More about birdy

**Birdy** is an infrared radiation (IR) device used for communication on-the-go!

IR is unaffected by the magnetic field of Ferros, making it the ideal solution for this new planet.

IR messages sent on-the-go on the **Birdy** are encoded in ASCII on a stationary device!

Messages are targeted: choose the bit sequence corresponding to the recipient and send.

Hello,
By the time this message reaches you, we'll be just reaching our destination solar system. From what we've learned on earlier missions, it's a good time to start drinking more water.
A few crew members have
experienced some memory gaps after the ten-month sleep, but were confident that someone like you, one of our most capable minds, will come through clear-headed.
If you happen to glance out the window, you might spot two other ships traveling in a similar direction. They're headed for different worlds, though. And between you and me, l'd say we got the most promising one. You probably remember that, before we launched, you
promised to spend some of the journey working on a solution to one of the issues we identified on the planet.
I'm really looking forward to seeing what you've come up with.
As you know, Ferros has a very strong magnetic field, making any large metal body always point north to south. This intense field also means that any electronics we bring to the planet cannot be moved after landing, as they will be ruined by the magnetic pull.
I packed you some cold snacks, enjoy them while you can as we've discovered that the native bacteria Robolicumosis causes food to spoil when it is cold, so we will need to keep all food warm while living on Ferros.
Don't be a stranger,
Best,
Your chief and companion, Commander General Zhuo
